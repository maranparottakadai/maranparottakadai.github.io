AIM:
  To write a C program to implement FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduling.

ALGORITHM:
  1. Read the number of processes.
  2. Read the process IDs and burst time (BT) for each process.
  3. CPU schedules processes according to their order of arrival in the ready queue (i.e., it first executes the process at the head of the queue).
  4. Set the waiting time (WT) of the first process as zero and its turnaround time (TAT) as burst time.
  5. Calculate waiting time and turnaround time of other processes as follows:
     - \( P_i (\text{WT}) = P_{i-1}(\text{WT}) + P_{i-1}(\text{BT}) \)
     - \( P_i (\text{TAT}) = P_i (\text{BT}) + P_i (\text{WT}) \)
  6. Calculate and display the average WT and TAT.
  7. Display the order of execution of processes, including process ID, burst time, WT, and TAT.

PROGRAM:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int pid[15];
    int bt[15];
    int n;

    printf("Enter the number of processes: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter process ID of all the processes:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &pid[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter burst time of all the processes:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &bt[i]);
    }

    int wt[n];
    wt[0] = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        wt[i] = bt[i - 1] + wt[i - 1];
    }

    printf("\nProcess ID\tBurst Time\tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time\n");
    float total_wt = 0.0;
    float total_tat = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d\t\t%d\t\t%d\t\t\t%d\n", pid[i], bt[i], wt[i], bt[i] + wt[i]);

        total_wt += wt[i];
        total_tat += (wt[i] + bt[i]);
    }

    float avg_wt = total_wt / n;
    float avg_tat = total_tat / n;

    printf("\nAvg. waiting time = %f\n", avg_wt);
    printf("Avg. turnaround time = %f\n", avg_tat);

    return 0;
}
