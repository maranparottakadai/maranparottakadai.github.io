AIM:
  To write a shell script to generate Fibonacci series.

ALGORITHM:
  Step1: Start the program.
  Step2: Enter the number.
  Step3: Initialize “b” and “d” is equal to zero.
  Step4: Using while loop, the Fibonacci series is generated.
  Step5: Terminate the program.

PROGRAM:
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series:"
read n
a=0
b=1
count=0

echo "Fibonacci series up to $n terms:"
while [ $count -lt $n ]; do
  echo $a
  fn=$((a + b))
  a=$b
  b=$fn
  count=$((count + 1))
done

echo "Program terminated."

OUTPUT:
[root@srmist ~]$ ./fibonacciSeries.sh
Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series:
5
Fibonacci series up to 5 terms:
0
1
1
2
3
Program terminated.
