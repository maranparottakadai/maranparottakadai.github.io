      AIM:<br />
      &nbsp;To understand the concept of database administration.<br /><br />

      PROCEDURE:<br />
      &nbsp;1. Select the system / application.<br />
      &nbsp;2. Include database administration methods.<br />
      &nbsp;3. Design the system for database administration.<br /><br />

      INTRODUCTION:<br />
      &nbsp;Database administration is the function of managing and maintaining
      database management systems (DBMS) software. Mainstream DBMS software such
      as Oracle, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server need ongoing management. As
      such, corporations that use DBMS software often hire specialized
      information technology personnel called database administrators or
      DBAs.<br /><br />

      TYPES OF DBAs:<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; System DBA<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Development DBA<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Application DBA<br /><br />

      SAMPLE CASE STUDY FOR FACULTY OF OPEN EDUCATION:<br /><br />

      THE DATA DEFINITION SUBSYSTEM:<br />
      &nbsp;The data definition subsystem helps define the structure of the
      files in the database. Data tables are designed on relational data tables.
      There are eighteen data tables provided by the relational database in this
      study (Table-1). In the relational data table, attributes represent
      necessary data summarized by the course book’s printing and royalty
      departments. The structure of the relational database in this paper is
      described.<br /><br />

      THE DATA MANIPULATION SUBSYSTEM:<br />
      &nbsp;The data manipulation subsystem lets us add and delete records,
      change field contents, and view the database. The information in a
      database can be viewed by using queries.<br /><br />

      <img
        src="../img/dt/database_admin/relationship_table.png"
        alt="relationship_table"
      /><br /><br />
      <img
        src="../img/dt/database_admin/data_tables.png"
        alt="data_tables"
      /><br /><br />

      &nbsp;The database is opened with the following start-up menu. The user
      has the following six main options: creation of necessary records of
      book’s characteristics; control of book storage; preparing royalties and
      storing personal (authors and publishers) information; and preparing any
      kind of reports to see information about books. User can quit the database
      by clicking “Programdan Çıkış” command button.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;User can add, edit, and delete records by using the following forms
      (Table 2):<br /><br />

      <img
        src="../img/dt/database_admin/database_forms.png"
        alt="database_forms"
      /><br /><br />

      &nbsp;For example, the “Printing” form includes all the fields necessary
      to define course books' printing information. It is used to enter new
      printing data into the database. An example of an input data screen is
      shown in Figure 3. The user selects the book’s name and fills out the
      necessary fields. The user can add a new course book to the database by
      clicking the “yeni kitap Ekle” command button. Modifications of existing
      data can also be made. The edit and delete operations are identical to the
      input data operations and work in the same way. This form also includes
      links for reports of printing data.<br /><br />

        src="../img/dt/database_admin/printing_forms.png"
        alt="printing_forms"
      /><br /><br />

      THE DATABASE ADMINISTRATION SUBSYSTEM:<br />
      &nbsp;Storing all course book information in a database has created the
      need for managing the database. In the relational database, data integrity
      and security are maintained by those who are authorized to use, update,
      and delete. The database administration subsystem allows us to establish
      users of the database, specify who can update information, and develop
      methods for backing up the database and recovering it in the event of a
      failure. For example, one form printing department could look at but not
      change information relating to the price of royalties.<br /><br />

      APPLICATION GENERATION SUBSYSTEM:<br />
      &nbsp;The application generation subsystem contains tools that help us
      create and update other features such as menus, data entry screen forms,
      reports, and application software. This study needs more time to examine
      further development of system implementation. For example, new orders can
      be taken from users, like new reports and data entry forms.<br /><br />

      CONCLUSION:<br />
      &nbsp;Until now, there have been no problems with the database. Users can
      use it easily without any issues. Everyone related to this data now uses
      only one database and can access it easily. By this study, data redundancy
      and integrity problems have been solved. Finally, in future studies,
      according to this relational database management system, a web-based
      system will be constructed.
