      AIM:<br />
      &nbsp;To understand the concept of database backups.<br /><br />

      PROCEDURE:<br />
      &nbsp;1. Select the system / application.<br />
      &nbsp;2. Include the backup methods.<br />
      &nbsp;3. Design the system for database backups.<br /><br />

      BACKUP:<br />
      &nbsp;A backup is a copy of data. It can include critical parts of the
      database such as data files, the server parameter file, and the control
      file. A sample backup and recovery scenario involves a failed disk drive
      causing data file loss. If a backup of the lost file exists, you can
      restore and recover it. Media recovery involves operations to restore data
      to its pre-loss state.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;RMAN is integrated with Oracle Secure Backup, providing reliable and
      centralized tape backup management, protecting both file system data and
      Oracle Database files. The Oracle Secure Backup SBT interface allows RMAN
      to back up and restore database files to tape and internet-based Web
      Services such as Amazon S3. Oracle Secure Backup supports most tape drives
      and tape libraries in SAN and SCSI environments.<br /><br />

      DATABASE BACKUPS:<br />
      &nbsp;Database backups can be physical or logical.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;Physical backups are copies of database files and are crucial for
      backup and recovery strategies. RMAN or operating system utilities can
      create these backups.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;Logical backups contain logical data like tables and stored
      procedures. Tools like Oracle Data Pump Export can extract logical data
      and save it in binary files. Logical backups supplement physical
      backups.<br /><br />

      PHYSICAL BACKUPS:<br />
      &nbsp;Physical backups are copies of physical files used for storing and
      recovering the database. These include data files, control files, and
      archived redo logs. Physical backups copy these files to a separate
      location, either on disk or offline storage media such as tape.<br /><br />

      LOGICAL BACKUPS:<br />
      &nbsp;Logical backups include data such as tables and stored procedures.
      Oracle Data Pump can export this data into binary files for future import.
      The <code>expdp</code> and <code>impdp</code> command-line clients use the
      DBMS_DATAPUMP and DBMS_METADATA PL/SQL packages.<br /><br />

      WHOLE AND PARTIAL DATABASE BACKUPS:<br />
      &nbsp;A whole database backup includes every data file plus the control
      file. This is the most common type of backup. Partial database backups
      include subsets of the database, such as specific tablespaces or data
      files.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;Tablespace backups require the database to be in ARCHIVELOG mode to
      ensure consistency with the rest of the database.<br /><br />

      BACKUP ADMINISTRATION TASKS:<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Planning and testing responses to different types of
      failures<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Configuring the database environment for backup and
      recovery<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Setting up a backup schedule<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Monitoring the backup and recovery environment<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Troubleshooting backup problems<br />
      &nbsp;&bull; Recovering from data loss if needed<br /><br />

      BACKUP SETS:<br />
      &nbsp;RMAN can create backups in a format called a backup set. This set
      contains data from data files, archived redo logs, control files, or the
      server parameter file. The smallest unit of a backup set is a binary file
      called a backup piece. Backup sets are the only format RMAN uses for
      writing backups to sequential devices like tape drives.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;Backup sets enable continuous tape streaming. For instance, RMAN can
      combine blocks from disks of varying speeds into one backup set to
      maintain a constant input stream for the tape device.<br /><br />

      &nbsp;Image copies are useful for disk backups as they can be updated
      incrementally and recovered.<br /><br />
