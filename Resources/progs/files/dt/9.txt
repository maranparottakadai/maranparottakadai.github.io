AIM:
  To create, insert, update, retrieve, and delete records in a Student database using SQL commands and manage data in a relational table format.

PROCEDURE:
1. Create a table named Student to store student information.
   - Columns include:
     - StudentID: Unique identifier for each student.
     - FirstName: Student's first name.
     - LastName: Student's last name.
     - Age: Student's age.
     - Major: Student's major field of study.

2. Insert records into the Student table:
   - Add entries for a few students with unique StudentIDs.

3. Update a student's age:
   - Change the age of a specific student.

4. Retrieve all records:
   - Use the SELECT statement to display all records in the Student table.

5. Delete a student record:
   - Remove a student with a specific StudentID.

6. Display the final table:
   - Use SELECT again to show the remaining records in the table.

SOURCE CODE:
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Major VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Major)
VALUES ('S001', 'John', 'Doe', 20, 'Computer Science');

INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Major)
VALUES ('S002', 'Jane', 'Smith', 22, 'Mathematics');

INSERT INTO Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Major)
VALUES ('S003', 'Alice', 'Johnson', 21, 'Biology');

UPDATE Student
SET Age = Age + 1
WHERE StudentID = 'S001';

SELECT * FROM Student;

DELETE FROM Student
WHERE StudentID = 'S003';

SELECT * FROM Student;

OUTPUT:
After executing the SQL commands, the final table will look like this:
| StudentID | FirstName | LastName | Age | Major              |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----|--------------------|
| S001      | John      | Doe      | 21  | Computer Science    |
| S002      | Jane      | Smith    | 22  | Mathematics        |
